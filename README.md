# Data-Science-Project
Data Sciente Project using Python. To run the code you need to install Jupyter or you can open it in Google Colab. The file "GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin" that is used in the code is also provided in the machine learning folder, however in the code the file is retrieved from Google Drive, because of its size. See the file DataProject.ipynb for the code.
